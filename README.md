"# Arduino-Processing" 

You will find here Processing sketches which can be used with serial data coming from an arduino board.

Feel free to change anything in the code, you can get details of the processing language at: https://processing.org/reference/

Several example are given, for some of them there are 2 versions, one with the serial port programmed, and one with only the graphic code.
